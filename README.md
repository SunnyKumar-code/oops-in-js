1. Encapsulation – “Data Protection”
Wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (object), and restricting direct access to some of the object’s components.

🧠 Think of it like a capsule – it hides the bitter stuff (data) and only lets you access it in a safe way.

2. Abstraction – “Show only what's necessary”
Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.

🧠 Like a TV remote – you don’t know how it works internally, you just use the buttons.

3. Inheritance – “Reusability”
One class (child) can inherit properties and methods from another class (parent), avoiding code duplication.

🧠 Like a child inheriting traits from their parents.

4. Polymorphism – “One name, many forms”
The ability to use a single method in different ways, depending on the object calling it.

🧠 Like the word “run” – you can run a race, run a company, or run a program. Same word, different meanings.
